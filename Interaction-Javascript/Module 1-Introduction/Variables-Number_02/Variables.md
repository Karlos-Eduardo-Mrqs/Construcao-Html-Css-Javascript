# Variables 
Variable is the name used to define one or more values ​​that are manipulated by programs during their operation. The name “variable” is used because it is a type of content that can present different values ​​while the system is running. Everything will depend on the user's command and the type of operation that is performed.

## Rules for Creating Variables

### 1. A variable is case-sensitive
This means that names with uppercase letters are different from names with lowercase letters: for a JavaScript program, Name is different from name.

### 2. Valid characters

- Words:
Although most browsers already recognize a variety of UTF-8 characters (such as words with accents and "ಠ_ಠ", for example), it is recommended to use only UPPERCASE and lowercase letters, without accents and spaces.

- Numbers:
As long as they are preceded by one or more letters.

- Underline and dollar sign:
"_" and "$" are also allowed in any position, but are rarely used.

### Variable Types 

#### 1. Variable
The types of variables that change their value during programming;

- Variable Syntax

```
var or let variable name = variable value; 
var age = 15; 
let age = 19;
```

#### 2. Constant 
The types of variables that do not change their value during programming;

- Constant Syntax
```
const variable name = variable value;
const Cpf= "155.688.997-77"
```

#### 3. Array
More robustly, an array is a data structure that serves to store elements in a memory space. 
These memory spaces are called variables. In the JavaScript course you learn everything about arrays, variables, types and much more.

- Sintaxe Array
``` 
let, var ou const nome do array = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
let frutas = ["Limão","Banana","Maçã","Uva","Laranja","Tomate","Manga","Maracuja","Morango","Melancia"];
```

#### 4. Object
Type of data/variable that functions as an independent entity, in which there is a set of attributes nested within a variable.

- Object Syntax
```
var, let or const variable name = {attribute1:value,attribute2:value,attribute3:value,attribute4:value}
```

# Data Types
Ok, now that you are more familiar with the use of the Javascript language, it is important to know what data types in variables are. Let's check out a list of them below:

## - String:
It can be any value that is enclosed in single quotes or double quotes and that normally represents text in general. These are letters, numbers and punctuation marks (using double or single quotation marks);

## - Numeric:
Numbers are used to represent numeric values ​​and can be integer or floating point;

## - Boolean:
Data that presents only two possible values ​​– true (true) or false (false);

## - Null and undefined:
These are data that represent variables that either have no value (null) or are incomplete (undefined);
