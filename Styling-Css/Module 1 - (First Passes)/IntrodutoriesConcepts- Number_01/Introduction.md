# What is CSS?
CSS is called Cascading Style Sheet language and is used to style elements written in a markup language like HTML. 
CSS separates the content from the visual representation of the website. Think about the decoration of your page. Using CSS it is possible to change the color of the text and background, font and spacing between paragraphs. You can also create tables, use layout variations, adjust images for their respective screens, and so on.

# CSS3 version
Although launched in 2010, CSS3 is the latest version of the Cascading Style Sheet and comes to improve upon previous versions. The best new feature is the flexibility in creating layouts, bringing more autonomy to web designers and developers alike. , which are somehow linked to the site's appearance. With CSS3, it is possible to create rounded corners, shadows, gradient effects, animations and transition effects, among other options.

## Types of CSS

1. Internal Style
Let's start with the internal style. CSS styles made this way are loaded every time a site is updated, which can increase loading times. Additionally, you will not be able to use the same CSS style on multiple pages as it is contained within a single page. But the advantage of this is that having everything on one page makes it easier to share the model for a preview.

2. External Style
The external method may be the most convenient. Everything is done externally in a .css file. This means you can do all the styling in a separate file and apply the CSS to any page you want. Exterior styling can also improve loading times.

3. Inline Style
Finally, there is also the CSS Inline style. Inline works with specific elements that have the ``<style> </sytle>`` tag. Every component must be styled, so it might not be the best or fastest for dealing with CSS. But it can be useful, for example, to change a single element, quickly preview changes, or if you don't have access to CSS files.

## Historical Summary 
CSS was developed by the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) in 1996, for a very simple reason. HTML was not designed to have tags that would help format the page. You should just write the markup for the site.

Tags like ``<font> </font>`` were introduced in HTML version 3.2 and caused a lot of problems for developers. Because websites had different fonts, colors, and styles, it was a long, painful, and expensive process to rewrite the code. Thus, CSS was created by the W3C to solve this problem.
